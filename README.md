🔐 Secure File Sharing System
📌 Project Description

This project, Secure File Sharing System, was developed as part of my Cyber Security internship task. The goal of the system is to provide a safe and reliable way to share files between users while ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and secure key management.

The project implements AES encryption to protect files during storage and transfer. Keys are securely generated and handled, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented. The system also includes a simple web interface for uploading and downloading encrypted files.

✨ Features

🔑 AES Encryption (Advanced Encryption Standard) for securing files

📂 Upload & Download functionality with automatic encryption/decryption

🛡️ Key Handling – keys are generated securely and not stored in plain text

🌐 User-friendly Web Interface built with Flask

📜 Documentation & Security Overview explaining encryption methods
